# Download Pre-open Market Data

You can download Pre-open Market data from https://howutrade.in/snapdata/?data=PreOpen_FO for NSE India F&O stocks. 

I have automated downloading and saving the data to CSV files using python's requests session object.

I've also added the CSV files in a zip file from 11-May-2018 to 28-Nov-2021.
