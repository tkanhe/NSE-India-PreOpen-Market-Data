# Download Pre-open Market Data

You can download Pre-open market data from https://howutrade.in/snapdata/?data=PreOpen_FO for NSE India F&O stocks. 

I have automated the process using the "PreOpen_data.py" file. You can change the `no_of_days` variable in the script as per the needs.

I've also added a Preopen_Market_Data_All.7z (7-Zip archive) file containing the Pre-open market data from 11-May-2018 to 31-March-2023.
